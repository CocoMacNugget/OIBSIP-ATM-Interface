# OIBSIP-ATM-Interface

## ATM Interface

We have all come across ATMs in our cities and it is built on Java. This complex project consists of
five different classes and is a console-based application. When the system starts the user is
prompted with user id and user pin. On entering the details successfully, then ATM functionalities
are unlocked. The project allows to perform following operations:

1. Transactions History

2. Withdraw

3. Deposit

4. Transfer

5. Quit

## Brief overview of my project:

As part of my internship program at Oasis Infobyte, I made a console-based ATM interface that will
allow the use to: deposite, withdraw, transfer money and view transaction history. once done the
user can quit.
